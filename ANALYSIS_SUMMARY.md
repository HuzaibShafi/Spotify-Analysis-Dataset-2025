## 🔍 Key Findings

### Most Important Features for Churn Prediction

1. **Subscription Type** (73.77% importance)
   - Premium users show significantly lower churn
   - Free tier users are at much higher risk

2. **User Tenure** (3.54% importance)
   - Newer users more likely to churn
   - Loyalty program effectiveness

3. **Customer Support Contacts** (3.27% importance)
   - Higher support contact = higher churn risk
   - Indicator of user frustration

4. **Days Since Registration** (3.03% importance)
   - Longer active period = lower churn
   - User habit formation

5. **Support Intensity** (2.99% importance)
   - Binary indicator of problematic accounts

### User Insights

#### Churn Risk Factors:
✅ **Low Risk**: Premium users with high engagement and long tenure  
⚠️ **Medium Risk**: Free users with moderate engagement  
🔴 **High Risk**: Free users with low engagement + support contacts

#### Recommendations:
1. **Focus on Free-to-Premium Conversion** - Subscription type is the strongest predictor
2. **Early User Engagement** - Interventions for new users in first weeks
3. **Support Proactive Measures** - Users contacting support need immediate attention
4. **Retention Campaigns** - Target users before 1 year of registration
